HW1 – Interpreting {ggplot2} Code
Purpose

This repository contains the materials for Homework 1, which focuses on interpreting and analyzing R code that produces UFO sighting visualizations using ggplot2 and related packages. The goal of this assignment is to understand the code structure, the functions used, and the visualization design choices.

Repository Contents

HW1.qmd – The Quarto file containing the code, analysis, and answers to homework questions.

outputs/ufo_sightings_infographic.pdf – The final infographic produced by the code.

images/ – Folder containing any images used in the plots (e.g., UFO icon).

fonts/ – Custom fonts used in the plots (Google fonts and Font Awesome).

Data Access

The UFO sightings data is publicly available online and loaded directly in the Quarto file using read_csv() from the URLs:

ufo_sightings.csv – UFO sighting reports

places.csv – State population information

No local data download is required to render the Quarto file.

Authors

Sarayu Ramnath – Interpreted the code, and used prexisting code to create infographic.
